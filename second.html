It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.
You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web.
You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.
Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it.
